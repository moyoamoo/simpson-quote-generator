# Simpson Quote Generator 

This a coding challenge completed during the Jump Software Bootcamp to learn about using functional React.js and getting familiar with using props, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) and incorperating APIs.

The project uses a Simspon quote generator API to get quotes and save into the state and local storage. Users can search for quotes and like their favourite quotes. Their favourite quotes can also be deleted and deleted quotes can be restored. Quotes can also be sorted by ASC/DESC/FAMILY NAME
